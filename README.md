# Bellabeat Case Study


This is a case study that I did in the Google Data Analyst Certificate. [Link to the Course](https://www.coursera.org/google/data-analytics)

The dataset being used contains anonymous fitness tracker data that is public domain.(source: dataset made available through Mobius, https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.X9oeh3Uzaao").

In the this case study I apply the findings to the "Bellatbeat App", that according to the descrition, tracks health data such as activity and sleep, among others.

The following Questions will be answered:


1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these Trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing Strategy

I also include a data cleaning report. Technologies that I used were SQL, MS-Excel and R for the main analysis.
